## DESIGN DOCUMENTATION

#### DESIGN PROCESS

I started planning my own portfolio website. It was a challenging but enjoyable experience that I really learned a lot from. My big initial goal was to create a unique online presence that represents my personality and displays my design work in detail. But as I go through it, a lots of the features and stylings were out of my understanding and scope. Hence, I have re-thought and built only the basic foundation for the website. And I shifted my goal to keep on updating the site as I go through the course so that it can be from a personal webpage to a professional dev portfolio. 

The first thing I do was to figure out what I want to achieve and I wrote it down.

Using [TRELLO](https://trello.com) to monitor my project online

Then I drafted the checklist in order to tick all the project's requirements as I start building the website.

I drafted the contents for the site.

As this is my first ever project online, I used my drafted workflow to give me a guide on my progress. It helps me to organise my tasks and estimate the amount of time each will take.
* Day 1: Design, Wireframing, Contents, Research on Themes, Layouts, Typography and Inspirational Portfolios
* Day 2: Building the site on HTML and Styling with CSS
* Day 3: Continue Building the page
* Day 4: Continue Building the page
* Day 5: Testing the page on multiple browsers and fixing any flaws
* Day 6: Putting all documentations together: README.md, pictures, screenshots, presentation etc.

## INTERESTING TOPICS

###  Key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today 
* In 1984, the used-to-be Arpanet was renamed the Internet when it linked 1000 hosts at university and corporate labs
* By 1998, the Internet saw 50 million users, supported by about 25 million servers
* By 2009, the Internet linked more than 440 million computers directly and topped 1 billion users
* By 2012, the global internet reached 2.1billion people
* Today, there are more than 50% of the world's population using the Internet

### The relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers 

* Domains are the unique url for accessing server data
* Web Servers provide storage space and an IP address for domains
* DNS Servers translate a website name to an IP address that tells which web server is hosting the website. Hence, without DNS, the web browser does not know where to go to get to the site.
* Web browser acts as a mean between web servers and the domains


### Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today 

In my opinion, one of the most important aspect of internet technologies these days is blockchain technology. It enables businesses to do things that have never been done before. The technology enables two parties to establish trust independent of a central institution. Its application is to ensure transparency and confidence in businesses' decision making. 
One of the most critical element of Blockchain technology is that information cannot be imitated or passed off as something it is not. Its information is open-sourced and the flow of information can be checked, reviewd and validated by global community. Hence, there is no chance for people to corrupt the system.
